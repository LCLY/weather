# Weather App
A webpage to display weather based on city and country

Alternative UI Behavior
- For the search history list, an alternative way is to not add new rows to the list when querying weather from history but since timestamp is involved, I reckon I should add new row to the list regardless where is it querying from

- Both inputs can be set to required so user has to enter both city and country before making queries
